# cnc-mill-enhancements-using-a-deep-neural-network-approach
Most cnc mill spindles typically get worn out which can cause a major problem when cutting metal or wood for production purposes.
Using a deep neural network model there can a be a possible solution to this problem without "eyeballing" or hinting whether or not a spindle should
be replaced. By using cnc data obtained from the machine's software we can develop a NN and compare data coming from an unused spindle and used spindle 
by using velocity measurements and pressure measurements from both of the spindles.
