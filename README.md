Most CNC mill spindles typically get worn out which can cause a major problem when cutting metal or wood for production purposes.
Using a deep neural network model there can a be a possible solution to this problem without "eyeballing" or hinting whether or not a spindle should
be replaced. By using CNC data obtained from the machine's software we can develop a neural network and compare data coming from an unused spindle and used spindle 
by using velocity measurements and pressure measurements from both of the spindles.
